## Overview

### Description

A small responsive web application that requests data to the Hackers News public API.

This web application is part of a technical test for [Reign company](https://www.reign.cl/en/).

### Demo Link

[Deployment of the web app on Netlify](https://compassionate-aryabhata-eef162.netlify.app/)

### Requeriments

- The user will be able to filter the news based on a specific topic selected from the dropdown.
- The user will be able to keep the same filter in the dropdown even after refreshing the page.
- The user will be able to mark any post as a favorite.
- The user will be able to check the favorite posts in the tab "My Faves".
- The user will be able to keep the same favorite posts even after refreshing the page.
- The user will be able to read a complete post by clicking on any part of the post (except on the "like button").
- The user will be able to properly interact with the web application regardless of the viewport size.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
